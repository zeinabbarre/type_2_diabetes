The strucutre of your folders should be the same as this. 
Open up vscode and create a type_2_diabetes folder and in it create an instance folder. This will be the path that you will quote when asked for the database path.
The databse will 
Create the other folders - csv_files, py_codes and templates (all of them in the type_2_diabetes folder. 
In github. its called py codes but that was a mistake - save it as py_codes.
Create a static folder (not statics) within the type_2_diabetes folder. Within the statics folder, create a new folder called images. 

Open up the terminal and cd to your instance folder. e.g mine would be /Users/zeinabbarre/Desktop/type_2_diabetes/instance.
Create a new database to store all of the info using sqlite3 db.db.
Check that you have correctly created the databse by typing sqlite> .database
(my example: /Users/zeinabbarre/Desktop/type_2_diabetes/instance/db.db)

Copy the CREATE TABLES commands found in the schema tables file on Github into sqlite. Make sure to copy everything including the UPDATE commands.

Download and save all the csv_files from GitHub to the csv_files folder within your own type_2_diabetes folder. 

In VScode, within the type_2_diabetes folder, create a web_application.py file. Copy and paste the code from the web_application.py file from Github.
Move to the py_codes folder and create all of the .py files that are in the py_codes and copy and paste the code.

Move to the templates folder and create all of the hmtml files that are in the GitHub templates folder. Copy and paste each files code and save.

Edit the paths to your csv files and database to make sure they are correct. To find your database path in sqlite, type .database
To find which file to use to populate the table, check the .py file you are trying to use.
E.g. if i am using the populating_snp_table.py, i will check the csv file path and choose unique_snps.csv.
